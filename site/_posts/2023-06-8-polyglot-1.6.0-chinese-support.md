title: Polyglot 1.6.0 and Simplified Chinese language support
lang: en
---

The [Polyglot website](https://polyglot.untra.io/zh-CN/) has been updated with support for Chinese!

This is made possible by **[aturret](https://github.com/aturret)**, who contributed numerous bugfixes to the plugin, the website, and an entirely new site translation.

Additionally, [jekyll-polyglot 1.6.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-polyglot/versions/1.6.0) is now available from rubygems.

## Fix for relativization of frozen strings

Polyglot used [String::gsub!](https://apidock.com/ruby/String/gsub!) which mutates a `.frozen?` string. This has now been fixed to duplicate the cloned string before modifying it.

## Fix for site navigation not being translated

A typo in the html on the site layout prevented the previous page navigation from being translated correctly.

## Support for Chinese Language

With a big 谢谢 of support and appreciation to **aturret**, [polyglot.untra.io](https://polyglot.untra.io/zh-CN) now supports a `zh-CN` Simplified Chinese translation!
